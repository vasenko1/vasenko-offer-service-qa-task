# Description
This project is a simple web application containing a rest api and a basic user interface to manage offers. An Offer
consists in 4 fields:

- id           (autogenerated)
- name         (text mandatory)
- description  (text mandatory)
- prize        (number mandatory)

## Task requirements
    - Create e2e tests in e2e module involving both user interface and api
    - Create integration tests for the offer-service apis in offer-service module (./offer-service/src/test/java/com/lottoland/offer/integration/)
    - There are some intended mistakes in code, try to find them by tests (so some of your tests will fail)
    - Include all scenarios in tests that you can think, but is ok if you don't implement all of them
    - Please add an info (console commands) how you will run your tests from console (assuming it can be reused for CI/CD)

_Note: Feel free to modify this readme_
